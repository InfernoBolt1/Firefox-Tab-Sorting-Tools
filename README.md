# Tab Sorting Tools – A Firefox Extension for Advanced Tab Management

**Tab Sorting Tools** is a Firefox extension that enhances the tab bar by adding right-click context menu options for managing multiple selected tabs. It allows you to reverse, sort, randomise, move, and undo actions on selected tabs quickly and efficiently.

## Features

- **Reverse** the order of selected tabs
- Sort selected tabs **alphanumerically by title**
- Sort selected tabs **by URL**
- **Randomly sort** selected tabs
- Move selected tabs to the **start** of the tab bar
- Move selected tabs to the **end** of the tab bar
- **Undo** the last tab operation

> **Note:** These actions apply only to tabs selected manually using `Ctrl+Click` (or `Cmd+Click` on macOS) in the tab bar.

## Requirements

- **Current stable version of Firefox**
- Permissions: `tabs`, `menus`, `notifications`

This extension is only supported on the latest stable release of Firefox.  
Older Firefox versions are not supported.

The extension requests these permissions on installation. It will not function without them.
