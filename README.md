# Tab Sorting Tools – A Firefox Extension for Advanced Tab Management

**Tab Sorting Tools** is a Firefox extension that enhances the tab bar by adding right-click context menu options for managing multiple selected tabs. It allows you to reverse, sort, or reposition selected tabs quickly and efficiently.

## Features

- **Reverse** the order of selected tabs
- Sort selected tabs **alphanumerically by title**
- Sort selected tabs **by URL**
- Move selected tabs to the **start** of the tab bar
- Move selected tabs to the **end** of the tab bar

> Note: These actions apply only to tabs selected manually using `Ctrl+Click` (or `Cmd+Click` on macOS) in the tab bar.

## Requirements

- Firefox 109 or later
- Permissions: `tabs`, `contextMenus`, `notifications`

The extension requests these permissions on installation. It will not function without them.
